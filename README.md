# Production-Grade Property Management System (PMS) Specification

A fully production-grade Property Management System (PMS) designed for industrial use. The system must operate with real-time/live updates â€” this is mandatory. Any change made by any staff member must instantly reflect on all connected devices without page refresh.

## âœ… Core Requirements

### Real-Time Data Synchronization

- WebSocket or equivalent bidirectional communication â€” no polling.
- Instant update propagation for all modules (reservations, room status, maintenance, housekeeping, folios, POS, etc.)
- Efficient handling of concurrent updates with conflict resolution.

### OTA Connectivity (Channel Management Integrated)

- Direct connection to major OTAs:
  - Booking.com
  - Airbnb
  - Expedia
  - Agoda
  - Trip.com (optional)
- Two-way sync:
  - Price & inventory updates to OTAs
  - Real-time reservation import from OTAs
- Prevent double-booking with strong locking & version control.

### Enterprise-Grade Architecture

- Deployable to Vercel frontend + scalable real-time backend (WebSockets/serverless pub-sub/cloud sockets).
- Cloud database with strong consistency (e.g., Firestore, Supabase, or equivalent).
- Supports multiple properties, multi-role access, and unlimited staff users.
- Designed for performance during peak booking activity.

### Cross-Platform Staff System

- Web app + optional mobile/tablet access for:
  - Front desk
  - Housekeeping
  - Management
- Roles & permissions control visibility and actions in real time.

### Instant Notification System

- Alerts for every key event:
  - New booking
  - Cancellations/changes
  - Check-in/out status updates
  - Maintenance flags
- Supports push notifications + in-app activity feeds.

### Security & Compliance

- Modern authentication (OAuth/JWT/Firebase Auth, etc.)
- Audit logs of all actions
- PCI-DSS-ready payment workflows (no local card storage)

### Modular & Expandable Design

- Ability to add POS, accounting, CRM, or BI analytics in the future.
- Public & secure REST/GraphQL API for integrations.

### Backup & Offline Readiness

- Failover protection and background sync support if connectivity drops.
